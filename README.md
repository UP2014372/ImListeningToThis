## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a web app that allows you to generate an image with the metadata of a song that you are currently listening to. It uses the Spotify API to get the song's metadata and then generates an image.

The purpose of this project is to explore web programming, specifically PKCE authentication, and to create a fun project that I can use to share what I'm listening to with my friends.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Online

This will be hosted on a website, but it isn't yet. So that's tough for now. Lol.

### Local

To run this locally, you will need to have a Spotify Developer account and create an app. You will also need to have Node.js installed.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

4. Run `npm start` to start the server
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
6. ???
7. Profit
